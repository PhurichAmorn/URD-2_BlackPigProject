# URD-2_BlackPigProject

The **Black Pig Project** is a mobile-based computer vision system that estimates pig weight using a **contactless top-down measurement method**.  
By capturing a top-down image of a pig and analyzing its **length and width**, the system predicts the pig’s **approximate weight** using a **local regression model** - all **without requiring internet access**.

## Purpose

Traditional livestock weighing methods require physical contact and specialized equipment, which can stress the animals and increase handling time.  
This project provides a **low-cost**, **non-invasive**, and **accessible** alternative that works **directly on mobile devices**, making it practical for farmers in both rural and modern environments.

## Features
- Pig top down view segmentation
- Depth prediction model
- Automatic detection of pig length and width 
- Regression-based weight estimation model
